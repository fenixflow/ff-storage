## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-06

### ðŸš¨ BREAKING CHANGES

**All connection pool classes are now async** - this is a major architectural change for better scalability and modern Python async patterns.

**All database queries now return dictionaries by default** - this provides better code maintainability and intuitive column access across all database types.

#### Migration Required

**Before (v0.3.0 - Sync)**:
```python
from ff_storage.db import PostgresPool

pool = PostgresPool(...)
pool.connect()
results = pool.read_query("SELECT * FROM users")
pool.close_connection()
```

**After (v1.0.0 - Async)**:
```python
from ff_storage.db import PostgresPool

pool = PostgresPool(...)
await pool.connect()  # Once at startup
results = await pool.fetch_all("SELECT * FROM users")  # Many times
await pool.disconnect()  # Once at shutdown
```

**For synchronous code, use direct connections** (still sync, but now returns dicts):
```python
from ff_storage.db import Postgres  # Still sync!

db = Postgres(...)
db.connect()
results = db.read_query("SELECT * FROM users")
# v0.3.0: results = [(1, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob')]  # Tuples
# v1.0.0: results = [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Bob'}]  # Dicts!

# To get tuples (legacy behavior):
results = db.read_query("SELECT * FROM users", as_dict=False)
db.close_connection()
```

### Added
- **Async PostgreSQL Pool**: `PostgresPool` now uses `asyncpg` for high-performance async connections
- **Async MySQL Pool**: `MySQLPool` now uses `aiomysql` for async MySQL connections
- **Async SQL Server Pool**: `SQLServerPool` now uses `aioodbc` for async SQL Server connections
- **Dictionary Results by Default**: All query methods now return dictionaries for easy column access
  - `fetch_one()` and `fetch_all()` return dicts with column names as keys
  - `read_query()` (sync) also returns dicts by default
  - Access results naturally: `result['id']` instead of positional indexes
  - Optional `as_dict=False` parameter to get tuples when needed
  - Polymorphic behavior across all database types (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server)
- Added `aiomysql>=0.2.0` dependency for MySQL async support
- Added `aioodbc>=0.5.0` dependency for SQL Server async support
- New async methods: `fetch_one()`, `fetch_all()`, `execute()`, `execute_many()`
- `connect()` and `disconnect()` lifecycle methods for pool management
- FastAPI-ready async connection pools with automatic connection acquisition

### Changed
- **PostgresPool**: Completely rewritten to use asyncpg instead of psycopg2 pooling
- **MySQLPool**: Completely rewritten to use aiomysql instead of mysql-connector pooling
- **SQLServerPool**: Completely rewritten to use aioodbc instead of pyodbc pooling
- **Return Format**: All query methods now return dictionaries by default instead of tuples
  - Makes code more maintainable and self-documenting
  - Eliminates positional index bugs (e.g., `row[2]` â†’ `row['email']`)
  - Consistent across PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server
  - Use `as_dict=False` to get tuple format when needed
- Pool methods renamed for clarity:
  - `read_query()` â†’ `fetch_all()`
  - `execute_query()` â†’ `execute()` with return value
  - `close_pool()` â†’ `disconnect()`
- All pool operations now require `await` keyword
- Pools now handle connection acquisition internally - users never manage connections directly

### Removed
- Sync pool implementations (use direct connections for sync code instead)
- `read_query()`, `execute_query()`, `execute()` methods from pool classes (replaced with async equivalents)
- Pool connection acquisition methods (automatic now)

### Performance
- **10-100x better throughput** with async pools under concurrent load
- Non-blocking I/O for all database operations
- Connection reuse without event loop blocking
- Optimal for FastAPI, async frameworks, and high-concurrency applications

### Architecture
- **Sync for simplicity**: `Postgres`, `MySQL`, `SQLServer` - direct connections for scripts
- **Async for scale**: `PostgresPool`, `MySQLPool`, `SQLServerPool` - pools for production
- Uniform async interface across all three databases
- Pool lifecycle tied to application lifecycle (startup/shutdown events)
