"""
TDD test suite for WHERE clause precedence and SQL escaping bugs.

This test file was created BEFORE fixing the implementation, following proper TDD practice.
All tests in this file MUST fail with the buggy implementation (v3.3.0-broken) and
MUST pass with the fixed implementation.

Critical bugs being tested:
1. Precedence preservation: (a OR b) AND c â‰  a OR b AND c
2. SQL string escaping: 'O''Reilly' must preserve doubled quotes
3. Semantic correctness: Different WHERE clauses must normalize differently
