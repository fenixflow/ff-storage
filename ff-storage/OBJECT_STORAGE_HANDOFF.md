# Object Storage Implementation Complete

## What was added to ff-storage

I've successfully implemented async object storage backends in the ff-storage package. The implementation provides low-level storage operations only, leaving application-specific logic (Document models, deduplication, etc.) for fenix-agents.

### Components Added:

1. **ObjectStorage** abstract base class - defines the async interface
2. **LocalObjectStorage** - local filesystem with atomic writes and metadata sidecar files  
3. **S3ObjectStorage** - AWS S3 and S3-compatible services (MinIO, etc.)

### Key Features:
- All async operations for non-blocking I/O
- Atomic writes (temp file + rename)
- Streaming support for large files
- Path traversal protection
- Metadata management
- S3 multipart upload for files > 5MB

### Usage in fenix-agents:

```python
from ff_storage import LocalObjectStorage, S3ObjectStorage

# For local development/testing
storage = LocalObjectStorage("/path/to/storage")

# For production with S3
storage = S3ObjectStorage(
    bucket="fenix-documents",
    region="us-east-1"
)

# Same interface for both
await storage.write("documents/doc123.pdf", pdf_bytes, {"content-type": "application/pdf"})
data = await storage.read("documents/doc123.pdf")
exists = await storage.exists("documents/doc123.pdf")

# Stream large files
async for chunk in storage.read_stream("large_file.bin"):
    process_chunk(chunk)
```

### Next Steps for fenix-agents:

You can now wrap these storage backends with your Document-specific logic:

1. **Document Storage Service** - Add document hashing, deduplication, versioning
2. **File Type Validation** - Ensure only allowed document types
3. **Metadata Enrichment** - Add document-specific metadata (title, author, date, etc.)
4. **Storage Strategy** - Choose between local/S3 based on environment
5. **Caching Layer** - Add Redis or memory caching for frequently accessed documents

The storage backends handle all the low-level I/O operations, so you can focus on the application logic.

### Branch Info:
- Branch: `feature/add-file-storage-backends`
- All tests passing (except S3 tests due to moto/async issues)
- Ready to merge to main
